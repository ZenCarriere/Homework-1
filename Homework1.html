    <h2>About Zen</h2>
    <p>This is my second time being in a program at Fanshawe. I have previously completed 3 semesters in the Computer Program analyst before deciding it wasn't for me. I always enjoyed the classes that focused on the front end of things such as web design. Feeling as though I wanted to stay in the tech field while finding a more creative way of doing so lead me here to IDP. My interests include film, music, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
