		<p> Hello, my name is Aaron. I like to play Videogames, sing, play guitar, and make things. I took Electromechanical Engineering Technician two years ago, and after two years I found out that perhaps I should be doing something more creative as a career. So that's what brough me to this program. I like space and I have some pretty big ideas for what I want my end of semester website to be so I'm going to have to be ahead of the curve. I think you're a very approachable teacher and I appreciate how you encourage us to be ourselves and be open.</p>
